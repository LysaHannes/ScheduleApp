Schedule App Using Android Studio

I used the Iguana version of android to create this app. 
It only works for the Month of June at the moment since I wanted to make my own calander instead of using the default one. 

Has many funtionalities including:
 - Adding Event
   -   Event Name
   -   Date
   -   Time
   -   Contact (From your phones contacts)
 - Editing Events
   - Event Name
   -   Date
   -   Time
   -   Contact (From your phones contacts)
 - Deleteing events
 - Clearing all events
 - Clearing a selected days events
 - Pushing a selected days events to the next day
